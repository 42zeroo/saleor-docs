## Introduction

Since version 3.0 Saleor supports multichannel. This feature allows the shop owner for configuring many aspects of the store depending on a channel.

- Your store need at least one channel to display products
- You can add as many channels as you need
- Each channel have exactly one currency
- Channels can be deactivated

Popular use cases:
- If you sell internationally, you can use separate channels for different currencies or regions
- If you want to have different prices in the custom mobile app and website, you can set up website-channel and mobile-channel

There are many models which can be customized per Channel. Details which fields can be defined on per-channel basis are defined in ChannelListing models:
- [Collection](categories-and-collections.mdx#collectionchannellisting) 
- [Product](products.mdx#productchannellisting)
- [ProductVariant](products.mdx#productvariantchannellisting)
- [Sale](discounts.mdx#salechannellisting)
- [ShippingMethod](shipping.mdx#shippingmethodchannellisting)
- [Voucher](discounts.mdx#voucherchannellisting)


## Permissions

To list, create, edit, remove, or deactivate channel `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission is required.
To edit for example Product availability in Channel, no additional permission besides `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` is needed.


# Api Reference

## Models

### Channel
```graphql
type Channel implements Node {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  isActive: Boolean!
  slug: String!
  currencyCode: String!
  hasOrders: Boolean!
}
```

- `id`: Channel object ID
- `name`: Channel name
- `isActive`: Flag which changes if channel is available for shop customers
- `slug`: When using channel depending queries, slug is used for selecting right one (for example when requesting Product details)
- `currencyCode`: Currency used by the channel. Using [ISO 4217](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) codes is recommended, but not required
- `hasOrders`: Returns `true` when there are already created orders using that channel. If thats the only Channel using this currency, you won't be able to remove it

## Queries

### Channel details
```graphql
channel(
id: ID
): Channel
```

- `id`: ID of Channel 

### Channel list

```graphql
channels: [Channel!]
```

Because some of the channels may be considered non-public (for example - channel for business partners), non-staff users can not list channels. 

<GraphQL
  height={20}
  query={`query {
  channels{
    name
    currencyCode
  }
}`}
/>

## Mutations

### Creating a Channel

```graphql
channelCreate(
input: ChannelCreateInput!
): ChannelCreate

input ChannelCreateInput {
  isActive: Boolean
  name: String!
  slug: String!
  currencyCode: String!
}

type ChannelCreate {
  channelErrors: [ChannelError!]!
  channel: Channel
}

```

- `channelName`: Channel name
- `slug`: slug which will be used to identify proper channel for example in product queries
- `isActive`: inactive channels cannot be queried by non-staff users
- `currencyCode`: currency assigned for this channel

<GraphQL
  height={30}
  query={`mutation {
  channelCreate(input:{
    name:"New Channel", 
    slug: "new-channel", 
    currencyCode: "USD"
  }){
    channel {
      id
      name
    }
    channelErrors{
      message
    }
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "channelCreate": {
      "channel": {
        "id": "Q2hhbm5lbDoz",
        "name": "New Channel"
      },
      "channelErrors": []
    }
  }
}`}
  readOnly={true}
/>

### Activate / Deactivate channel

If you want to make the channel unavailable for customers, you can change its status to deactivated: 

```graphql
channelActivate(id: ID!): ChannelActivate

type ChannelActivate {
  channel: Channel
  channelErrors: [ChannelError!]!
}

channelDeactivate(id: ID!): ChannelDeactivate

type ChannelDeactivate {
  channel: Channel
  channelErrors: [ChannelError!]!
}

```

<GraphQL
  height={30}
  query={`mutation{
   channelDeactivate(id: "Q2hhbm5lbDoxMQ=="){
    channel {
      name
      isActive
    }
    channelErrors {
      message
    }
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "channelDeactivate": {
      "channel": {
        "name": "Facebook",
        "isActive": false
      },
      "channelErrors": []
    }
  }
}`}
  readOnly={true}
/>

And to reverse the previous operation:

<GraphQL
  height={30}
  query={`mutation{
   channelActivate(id: "Q2hhbm5lbDoxMQ=="){
    channel {
      name
      isActive
    }
    channelErrors {
      message
    }
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "channelDeactivate": {
      "channel": {
        "name": "Facebook",
        "isActive": true
      },
      "channelErrors": []
    }
  }
}`}
  readOnly={true}
/>

### Channel Delete

```graphql
channelDelete(
id: ID!
input: ChannelDeleteInput
): ChannelDelete

input ChannelDeleteInput {
  targetChannel: ID!
}
```

- `id`: Channel ID which will be deleted
- `targetChannel`: Orders created in Channel beeing deleted will be moved into `targetChannel`. Only requirements are the same `currencyCode`, also `targetChannel` different than `id` 


## ChannelError

```graphql
type ChannelError {
  field: String
  message: String
  code: ChannelErrorCode!
}

enum ChannelErrorCode {
  ALREADY_EXISTS
  GRAPHQL_ERROR
  INVALID
  NOT_FOUND
  REQUIRED
  UNIQUE
  CHANNEL_TARGET_ID_MUST_BE_DIFFERENT
  CHANNELS_CURRENCY_MUST_BE_THE_SAME
}
```

- `ALREADY_EXISTS`: Object already exist in database
- `GRAPHQL_ERROR`: Wrong query
- `INVALID`: Invalid data provided
- `NOT_FOUND`: Could not found object
- `REQUIRED`: Missing required fields
- `UNIQUE`: Provided value for field needs to be unique
- `CHANNEL_TARGET_ID_MUST_BE_DIFFERENT`: You must specify other channel where existing orders will be moved
- `CHANNELS_CURRENCY_MUST_BE_THE_SAME`: Target channel has to have the same currency
