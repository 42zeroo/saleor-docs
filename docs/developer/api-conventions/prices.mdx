## Introduction 

Saleor API have 4 different types for prices, depending on taxes and eventual price range. 
Althrough using [ISO 4217](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) codes for currency is recommended, we allow using custom ones. 

## Frontend integration

# Api Reference

### Money
Basic type for keeping prices without taxes. We do not restrict currency code values, so you can even use cryptocurrencies or other custom currency.

type Money {
  currency: String!
  amount: Float!
}
```

- `currency`: Currency code for price. Currency depends on chosen Channel.
- `amount`: Price amount.

## TaxedMoney
Most used example of TaxedMoney is ProductVariant price. Even if you do not use any taxes integration, both net and gross prices will be populated with the same value.

```graphql
type TaxedMoney {
  currency: String!
  gross: Money!
  net: Money!
  tax: Money!
}
```

  stop: Money
}
```
